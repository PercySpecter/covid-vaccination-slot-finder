This tool allows you to quickly search for free vaccination slots in any district on India without the hassle of login or OTP authentication.

Credits to [araujoigor](https://github.com/araujoigor) for the [JSONGrid library](https://github.com/araujoigor/json-grid) that I used to display the data.

**NOTE:** This tool does not allow you to schedule vaccination appointment. That has to be done through the [CoWIN Website](https://www.cowin.gov.in) or the CoWIN mobile app.
